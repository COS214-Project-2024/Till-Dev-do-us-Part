## ABOUT THE PROJECT
**INGELAND** is a City Builder Simulation developed by Team-18, titled **TDP - TILL DEV DO US PART**. In this engaging simulation, a player manages an urban environment, making critical decisions to ensure citizen satisfaction and efficient resource allocation. This project addresses the complexities of urbanization, including resource management, transportation, taxation, and citizen interactions. By employing object-oriented principles and design patterns, the simulation aims to create a scalable and maintainable software system that shows the challenges such as resource scarcity and urban illness. It provides an engaging experience that demonstrates how citizens interact with various city components to survive in their INGELAND CITY.


## FEATURES
- **Build and Manage Your City**: Create a thriving city with:
  - **Transport Department**: Build roads, train stations, bus stations and airports.
  - **Development Department**: Construct residential, commercial, industrial, and landmark structures.
  - **Government**: Have a government with different departments at the beginning of the game to influence city dynamics.
  - **Resource Department**: Collect and utilize resources effectively to satisfy citizen needs and enhance city growth.
  - **Social Affairs Department**: Make decisions that impact the well-being of citizens to reduce congestion and improve overall satisfaction.
  - **Finance Department**: Manage the city's budget, focusing on taxation policies for citizens and businesses to ensure sustainable economic growth while funding essential services.
